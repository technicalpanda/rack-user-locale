# Rack User Locale

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rack-user-locale.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/rack-user-locale)
![CI](https://github.com/technicalpanda/rack-user-locale/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A Rack module for getting and setting a user's locale via a cookie or browser default language.

## Requirements

* Ruby >= 2.7

## Installation

```
gem install rack-user-locale
```

In a Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rack-user-locale'
```

## Usage

Add the following line to your Rack application

```ruby
use Rack::UserLocale
```

and thats it!!

Your application will now attempt to set the I18n.locale value based on the following:

- Whether a user has a `user-locale` cookie set
- The "HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE" value. If there are multiple values it will attempt to set the one ranked highest
- The I18n.default_locale value (basically a fallback)

**Note:**

The user locale detection is done on every Rack::Request, which would include all of the non Ruby/Rack actions like .css or .js files.

If you don't want this happen then you can use Rack::Static in your application and filter out which files Rack should serve up statically.

Something like this:

```ruby
use Rack::Static, urls: ["/css", "/js"], root: "public"
```

This would serve anything in your public folder statically and wouldn't create a Rack::Request.

See the [Rack::Static docs](http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/classes/Rack/Static.html) for more info.

## Options

### Accepted Locales

```ruby
use Rack::UserLocale, accepted_locales: [:de, :en, :es, :fr, :ja, :pt, :zh] #(whatever codes you support)
```

If this option is supplied the users locale will either be set to one of the accepted locales in the array, otherwise it will be set to the `I18n.default_locale` value.

Should you wish to overwrite a users locale value at any point in your application, like for changing language prefs, then simple rewrite the `user-locale` cookie with a new value.

### Cookie Name

If you don't want to use the default cookie name of `user-locale`, you can set it to something else by passing a `cookie_name` option.

```ruby
use Rack::UserLocale, cookie_name: "some-cookie-name"
```
